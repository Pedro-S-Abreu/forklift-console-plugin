# OVA Test Files

This directory contains sample OVA files used for testing the OVA provider upload functionality.

## Files

- `2nd_disk_v3.ova` (198KB) - Minimal OVA file for testing upload validation, file selection, and form interactions

## Purpose

These files are intentionally small test fixtures used to verify:
- File upload UI interactions
- File type validation (.ova extension)
- Upload button state management
- Clear/reset functionality

## Note

These are not full virtual machine images but minimal valid OVA files suitable for UI testing only.
